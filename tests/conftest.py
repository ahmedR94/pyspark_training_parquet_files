""" Script where we can place our fixtures to structure and arrange our test case data. 
The fixture can be reusable within a test file. Itâ€™s convenient to reuse the same fixture for different test cases. 
The fixture can be both data like our above mock data function, 
or it could be a spark environment we would like to initiate for the test session.
